"""
STEP 3: Detect bigrams and trigrams (2-word and 3-word phrases)

WHAT THIS DOES:
- Scans through 20M sentences to find common word combinations
- Example: "climate" + "change" appears together often → "climate_change"
- Creates models that will transform text in next step
- Saves to bigram_trigram_model/all_bigram_trigram_1.pkl

=== CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL ===
1. ADDED: Detailed logging and progress messages
2. ADDED: Statistics about vocab sizes and file sizes
3. ADDED: Sample phrase output to show what was detected
4. ADDED: Check if model already exists (skip if present)
5. CORE LOGIC: UNCHANGED - same gensim Phrases implementation
